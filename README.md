## Why is keyword extraction important?

Keyword extraction is a text analysis technique that pulls keywords from text. It is primarily used to summarize large quantities of textual data, using it to identify the key points of a text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and  machine learning are heavily used in keyword extraction to consolidate textual data and make it machine readable. Scalability, reliability, and real-time analysis, to name a few, are advantages of keyword extraction.

## When do organizations use keyword extraction methods?

You can find organizations using keyword extraction methods for customer support, analysis of customer feedback, obtaining business intelligence, and monitoring of social media.

## Methodology

In this keyword extraction project, I utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), scikit-learn's count vectorizer, and TFID transformer to extract a title, abstract, and top 10 scored keywords.
